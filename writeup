Inverted Index:
use of unordered map so as to make search O(1).
use of stemming, stop words removal, lowercase, punchuation removal as part of text preprocessing
things tried: more weight given to tags but had no effect on the metric

BM25 variant:
formula: log((N-df+0.5)/(df+0.5)) * (((k1+1)*k2*tf)/(k1*(1-b+b*(L/Lavg))+k2*tf)+Î´) * ((k3+1)*qf)/(k3+qf) 
 
N= total documents
df= document frequency
Term frequency(tf)
Query frequency(qf)

intresting observation: negetive value of delta resulted in better values of metric
